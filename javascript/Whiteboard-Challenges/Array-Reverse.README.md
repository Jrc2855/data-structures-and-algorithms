# Whiteboard: Reverse Array

## Problem Domain

Write a function called reverseArray which takes an array as an argument. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return an array with elements in reversed order. Modify the existing array in place and by the most efficient means.

## Test Cases

- Does arr.sort() yield the same result as reverseArray(arr)?
- Does it fail appropriately?
- Does arr return the same array as reverseArray(arr)?
- Is the array populated?
- Does Data Type Matter?
